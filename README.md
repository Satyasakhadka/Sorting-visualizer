# Sorting Visualizer

A web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms.
We shuffle the bars in a random order that is in an unsorted order.We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in an ascending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms.
The sorting algorithm we have user in our projects are:
1. Insertion sort
2. Merge sort
3. Selection sort
4. Quick sort 

Sorting Visualizer is a project done as a mini project for Data Structures & Algorithms, a course offered by the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University. It helped us apply the concepts of DSA and realise the potential of DSA in a real world project.
